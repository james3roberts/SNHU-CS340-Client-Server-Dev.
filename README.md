NoSQL mongoDB and python dashboard with plotly.
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
  I think the best way to achieve this is to make a function that will handle specific aspects 
  of the program. This will allow for smaller sections of code to be changed, updated, and maintained
  which will allow for more reusability. 
What are the advantages of working in this way?
  The advantage is that there is already a code base that can be copied and reused into a new program.
  Or this code can be used as a guide if there is a long break taken between using languages like there has
  been in these classes. 
How else could I use this CRUD python module in the future?
  I can copy this crud file in the future and rework it to fit the need at that time. 
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
  I make sure that I understand the problem, then I design a solution, create the solution. After that I run and test the solution. 
How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses?
  My approach was not any different than in other classes. I take the big picture and break it into smaller parts. While working through this class we basically have one week of sprints. The structure of the course is set up to tell us what the deliverables are for the week.
  So as long as you keep thinking of how the weekly project will join with the finished product the approach does not need to change.   
What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  I believe that in the future I would add the authentication towards the end of the project so that I would not have to worry about dealing
  with any issues that might bring up. 
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? 
  Computer scientist take problems that take a large amount of time, or that are complicated and create  programs that will help dodd them 
  quicker, or simpler. 
How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
  This project is a great example of how computer scientist fix a problem that is very time consuming and not necessarily simple and create 
  a program that will make it easy and quick.
